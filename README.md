# Class-Search
This is a learning project (Bootstrap and Vue) to recreate a responsive website to search for classes.


As a vehicle to learn BootStrap and Vue, this project seeks to develop a new class-search web application.
This application is being designed as a front-end only tool that consumes data from a JSON-based web service.

The application seeks to improve the UI/UX experience of the class-search application provided at:  https://www.csun.edu/class-search.
The JSON-based web service, known as the Curriculum Web Service, can be found at:  https://api.sandox.csun.edu
